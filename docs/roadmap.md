# SpaceTrains Roadmap

## Done

### Phase 1 — VariableISP Integration and Headless Verification (2026-05)

- Electric ion ship classes with tech-level parameters (α, ε).
- `VariableIspTrajectoryPlanner` backed by the precomputed trajectory atlas; per-sample propellant via the I-invariant scaling.
- Multi-planner dispatch by propulsion type; Lambert solver and NTR ships for the Kepler side.
- Headless executable with `--verbose`, `--econ-audit`, and periodic reports.

### Phase 2 — Godot Observer Frontend (2026-06)

- Bridge snapshots carry `trajectory_path`, destination ghost, and snapshot timing for smooth interpolation.
- Procedural sci-fi HUD (top bar, entity browser, inspector, market panel, event ticker).
- Starfield, Sun bloom/halo, planet textures, orbit rings, procedural ship/station meshes, trails, engine glow.
- Economy: dynamic prices, credits, trade settlement, storage caps, profit-based dispatch, fleet growth; fleet-collapse fix (730-day audit: 0 stranded).

## Next — Trajectory Correctness Over Long Runs (current)

Unphysical trajectories appear after months of self-play:

- A VariableISP path ends with a sharp dent: the integrated trajectory misses the destination and the final sample is snapped onto the station.
- A path loops around the Sun many times with only ~10 samples per revolution.

Plan:

- Add a headless trajectory validator (endpoint miss distance, revolution count, mass floor, sample spacing) and a `--trajectory-audit` run over a multi-year simulation to reproduce both.
- VariableISP: validate the integrated endpoint against the target (r, θ); refine the atlas seed with a few shooting/Newton iterations; reject and try the next launch window when it does not converge. Never snap a far miss.
- Atlas lookup: stop blending corners from different solution families and stop using a nearest-cell seed from a different (ρ, κ) without correction.
- Regression tests for every bad case the audit finds.

## Economy Follow-ups

- Re-run the 730-day audit; check whether goods still pile up at producers while consumers starve.
- Check whether short-hop clustering around Earth L1 survived the profit-based dispatch.

## Phase 3 — Persistence and Scenario Control

- Add save/load snapshots.
- Add seeded scenario setup and reproducible simulation runs (also needed to replay bad trajectories deterministically).
- Add scenario-level data for alternative starting economies or factions.

## Phase 4 — Richer Orbital and Mission Fidelity

- Improve Kepler planner with patched-conic SOI handoffs.
- Replace local direct-transfer approximation with proper planet-SOI arc (also fixes ~100% propellant use on Earth–Moon VariableISP-style hops).
- Add stranded-ship handling, support/refuel behavior, clearer mission state transitions.
- Consider outer Solar System bodies (Jupiter and beyond).

## Phase 5 — Ships with Individual Variation

- Add per-ship power multiplier (±α variation) and size multiplier.
- Size scaling preserves κ; power multiplier changes κ slightly per ship.
- Reflect individual ship specs in UI selection panel.

## Phase 6 — Post-v1 Systems

- Add pirates, police, inspections, rescue, and later combat resolution.
- Expand content: outer-system stations, more factions, science mission chains.
- Support custom star systems through data-only content changes.
